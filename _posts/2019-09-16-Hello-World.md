title: My First Blog Post
---

This is my first blog post using github.io. I find this process very interesting because I can create the blog website by myself! I will never forget this handy experience.

As a MDS-CL student, I really enjoy the COLX lab. We started last week writing nested loops to extract sentences with specific words or numbers, which was challenging but fun. The process to figure out the codes was the best experience for me because it was like solving a puzzle, and I was very excited when all tests were passed. Hope this journey will get more and more interesting in the coming year!
